# Weather App

A simple weather app that retrieves current weather data from OpenWeatherMap and displays it in a GUI.  **This project is for educational purposes only and should not be used in a production environment.**

## Description

This weather app is a Java-based program that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve current weather data for a given city. The app features a graphical user interface (GUI) that displays key weather information such as temperature and condition.

## Features

*   Input of the city name
*   Retrieval of weather data from OpenWeatherMap
*   Display of temperature and condition in the GUI
*   Input of the API key via a separate window

## Installation

1.  Make sure you have Java installed.
2.  Download the `org.json` library and add it to your project.
3.  Create a new Java project in your IDE (e.g. IntelliJ IDEA).
4.  Add the Java code (`WeatherApp.java`) to your project.
5.  Add the `org.json` library as a dependency to your project.

## Usage

1.  Run the app.
2.  Enter your OpenWeatherMap API key when prompted.
3.  Enter the name of the city for which you want to retrieve weather data.
4.  Click "Update Weather".
5.  The current weather data for the specified city will be displayed.

## API Key

You need an API key from OpenWeatherMap to retrieve the weather data. You can register for free at [Openweathermap](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up) and obtain an API key.

## Libraries

*   `org.json` (for parsing the JSON response from OpenWeatherMap)

## Improvement Opportunities

*   Add more weather information (e.g. wind speed, humidity)
*   Support for different languages
*   More appealing design of the GUI
